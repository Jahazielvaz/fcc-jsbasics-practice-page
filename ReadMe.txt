The map() feature is very powerful. You can apply the effects to each dataType in an array. The part that I still don't fully know is why or when exactly you need to have the array equal the array.map() and why you can't just do it directly.
Remember that when you call the function inside of the map higher order function, you should include the parenthesis.
